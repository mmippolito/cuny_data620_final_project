<h2>Using Network Graph Analysis to Cluster Similar European Languages</h2>
<br />
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<br />
It is common knowledge that many world languages are related to each other, with some borrowing words from others. For this project, I investigated similar words across various world languages, with the end goal being two-fold. First, I'll demonstrate how NLP and graph analytics can be used to evaluate which languages are most similar to each other. And second, I'll specificially focus on evaluating quantitatively which languages are most similar to several common languages. This isn't intended to be a comprehensive etymological study, but instead an application of both NLP and network graphs to perform a specific, limited analysis.<br />
<br />
Since the corpus of world languages is vast, I limited the texts I evaluated to a small subset of languages, specifically twenty-two which are spoken in Europe and which can be expressed using the Latin-1 character set. Further, I limited the text from each language to two specific corpora. The first is a document translated across all languages I'll evaluate in the project, namely the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights). The UDHR comes packaged into the NLTK and is translated into 335 languages with various encodings. The second set is a corpus of words translated using an online API called Yandex Translate. The words in the corpus are derived from a list of commonly used affixes and are used in this project to aid in comparing languages. The overal corpus consists of approximately 14,000 unique words, many of which are shared among multiple languages.<br />
